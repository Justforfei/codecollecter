								<p>Hi, I've used Basecamp considerably and I have to say I'm so impressed with Teamwork Projects compared to it, I love the flexibility of being able to assign a task to more than one person, prioritising tasks is great and the privacy button is definitely needed at times. A first class thought through package and the videos are such a help. I look forward to the rolling it out to our company.</p>

								<p>Simply the best.<br/>We've been testing (and using) some of the most known collaborative project management systems in the market, and actually we were resigned to their common limitations. Fortunately we met Teamwork Projects and we were very impressed with its brilliant features, workflow and look & feel. We definitively moved all our projects to Teamwork Projects.<br/>We use the moto "If you do it right, it will last forever". Please keep on doing it right ;) <br/></p>

								<p>Congratulations on an excellent product - and on getting the teamwork.com domain - which I believe is an excellent tool for project management. Having used many applications over the years, I am very impressed with your application and with your pricing model.<br/><br/>I established Trinity College's Programme Management Office some years ago and am now Programme Director of our GeneSIS Project and have seen the benefit of your product over a server based alternative. I hope to continue the use of Teamwork in Trinity and to extend it to other areas.</p>

								<p>I set-up Teamwork Projects for RAPP here in the UK for our offices spread across 4 different locations around England and Scotland. It's a pleasure to work with the system and we now have over 60+ team members using the system and more than 20+ projects. The main thing is that the system doesn't get in the way and lets you get on with the important elements - the business.</p>

								<p>Switching to Teamwork Projects was a no brainer.<br/>Over the last decade I have evaluated countless project collaboration and management tools, and implemented everything from Clarizen to Microsoft Project Server to Basecamp. Finally, with Teamwork Projects I have found a solution that is powerful enough to be valuable, yet intuitive enough that it is actually used.<br/></p>

								<p>I'm a veteran software developer, and I know how rare it is that someone calls or e-mails just to say that you're doing a good job.  Which is why I feel an especially strong urge to do just that.  You guys keep rolling out amazing upgrades (subtasks...THE BEST YET!), and the system just flat works great every day.  It's truly one of the best SaaS apps I've ever seen.  Thank you!!</p>

								<p>I recently chose Teamwork Projects to be our cloud project management system, and let me tell you this was no easy task picking a service. I didn't realize how many systems were out there, I must have looked at over 50 of them, and actually did the demo or free trials on more than 10 of them.<br/><br/>Our new website business bringing all the worlds best personal development teachers into one site needed a system that could collaborate with our team that is spread out geographically, we needed some strong project management features, we needed a strong task management system, and we needed to handle unlimited users and multiple projects, and we needed to have some strong permission sets on client users, good reporting features, and all in a straightforward and user friendly system.  <br/><br/>Teamwork Projects was the ONLY one that met all these requirements for us.  Not Basecamp, Zoho, Teambox, Deskaway, Proworkflow, 5pm, Taskpoint, Intervals, Wrike, Feng office, GoPlan, Smartsheet, Gantter, Comind, Manymoon, Glasscubes, Autotask, Project Insight, Mavenlink, and more… <br/><br/>There were some others that did meet our needs, but they were much more intensive and would have been too hard for our client base to learn to use, like @Task, Clarizen, Tenrox, Liquidplanner (these were also quite a bit more expensive as well).  Through all of this research, Teamwork Projects rose to the top, and since implementing it we are back on schedule to get our website launched this February.<br/><br/>And I love the roadmap, the openness of the company to share exactly what they are working on – shows they are on it!  Other companies hide this, and some don't even show their pricing, they make you call them – forget that!  <br/><br/>I am mostly writing this review, because I wish I had found a review like this in my searches, it would have saved me days and days of researching all these other products, so I hope this can help others save time in their search.</p>

								<p>By far the best SaaS based project management solution I've seen!<br/><br/>I'm director of IT and IS for a medium size business in So Cal area. I've been looking for an online project management tool to use with my project team. I found you guys on Google and I must say I love this product so far.<br/><br/>I'm using the free account to get used to the features but I have to say, this squashes some of the other apps I've seen in the market. Love the interface, the layout, and the features. I'm trying to think if there's anything I need that's not here but I'm not finding anything yet.<br/><br/>You guys are awesome!</p>

								<p>Eureka... At last I found it! For the last 7 years I have been struggling to get an online PM tool that can save my team of artists from the complexity and usability of UI. Sometimes it was the cost too that was too discouraging. I must say, Teamwork Projects fits my bill and also my company. It was learnt in a day by my team and now they have adapted it on their day to day work. Thanks for the Android, Ipad and Iphone App. Life is easier now. Thanks to your team from the bottom of our heart.</p>

								<p>We searched long and hard for a Basecamp alternative, and we just fell in love. At the risk of sounding overly dramatic, we are blown away by how good Teamwork Projects is compared to Basecamp. We're a team of visual people. Basecamp is certainly elegant and simple, but we just weren't finding it very useful, and frankly a little TOO simple for our needs. After many hours of searching for alternatives, we liked what we saw and decided to give this a shot by migrating one of our Basecamp projects over a just few days ago. We simply can't believe how much more flexible, powerful, and feature rich this is - we're still discovering features we didn't even know about. </p>

								<p>ProWorkFlow's "complex" image made me research further. Their system looks beefy.. but yours has most of the same features. I prefer the look of yours MUCH better.. I trust that if I sent a login to a freelancer or client they would have NO trouble figuring out what to do. I also LOVE the "notebook" feature in your system and the tab labels are nice and self-explanatory. These are the finishing touches that set you apart from Basecamp.<br/><br/>I've spent 2 solid days sitting in this chair researching Project Management software applications. It is a tough choice and I think I am going a little crazy with all the options. I hope you keep growing your application because it is so friendly to use. I will definitely recommend your product.</p>

I have been searching for a tool to not only help me organize my projects but help me grow my business. I searched through the list of Project Management software available today and decided to try out Teamwork Projects, which has exceeded my expectations.<br/><br/>In just 2 short weeks, with the help of the TeamWorkPM amazing support team I was able to organize my clients, their projects, keep my clients informed, increase client project engagement, run reports on the projects, view summaries, be updated on the road in real time and so much more. Plus thanks to TeamWork and the support team showing me how to streamline my business I have signed on 2 new clients and have a 3rd one coming on potentially today, just in the last 2 weeks.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a project management software that manages your clients and your business projects as well helps you grow your business I highly recommend you give TeamWork Projects a try.</p>

								<p>I am PM freak. I am very picky. I've used Basecamp, Teambox, Trello and a whole other huge number of other softwares. Nothing really felt easy and always seemed missing something. Teamwork Projects is not perfect... but it's the best I know. I sent a suggestion to the team and... surprise! On the very same day I got an answer. I doubted it a bit. I sent another suggestion. WHAM! Second response on the same day. Can you believe this ? I still can't. Now if you follow those suggestions, you'll make me a very happy PM! Great great work guys.</p>

								<p>After an evaluation of 10 project management tools we chose teamwork as our main solution for handling large scale projects. <br/><br/>We are a startup company in Switzerland and use only teamwork to collaborate with our customers, partners and other stakeholders. Our business is project management of a well known IT solution for marketing. We are working according the project management method of PRINCE2 and we are pleased, how teamwork supports us in simplifying the complex processes and documents. <br/><br/>It's easy to use for our customers. They can concentrate on the project content and don't need to worry about the handling of the software. Everything is tracked and connected what exists about the project. It's such an amazing solution that we even started to use it for internal tasks and processes too. <br/><br/>Thank you very much for this great piece of software and keep on going with nice features. </p>

								<p>On the beginning of 2013, we decided to take our company out of excel files and desktop based software and go to the cloud based apps. This was a big change that improved a lot of our processes after a user resistance, waiting for replies of support and training employees (and forcing then to use the software). <br/><br/>With Teamwork, we had THE FASTEST implementation, one of best and fastest customers support (phone and mail) and offered a quick result in our company. I wish we had met TW earlier. <br/><br/>Our customers are using it in our sub-domain and they had a 100% ACCEPTANCE. All of them gave us a great feedback of "our new system". Teamwork was the first software that deserves to be paid even with free trial days left ;-) <br/><br/>We are a corporation with different offices around the world that has many different parts involved in a project. Teamwork manages our project with great privacy control on tasks, adds value to our company on the branding option and had a good acceptance when you look into the user point of view.</p>

								<p>What an awesome program<br/><br/>Teamwork Projects Rocks !<br/><br/>I am the Director of a Facilities Group for a school district.

It proved to be so useful that now I use it day in and day out for all of my projects and along the way I am bringing others on board. It is so easy to use but so powerful and the Daily Project email Report, that is such a great feature.<br/><br/>Everything is always at my finger tips for all of my projects on any of my devices. Never have I been able to collaborate and track task so efficiently with all of my project managers and project teams. Each day I find more useful features and tools to help me get the jobs done.<br/><br/>I don't generally do this sort of thing but I thought you needed to know.<br/>Please keep up the great work guys!</p>

								<p>The last Project Manager you'll ever need.<br/><br/>Who would have thought that it was possible for a person to fall, truly, madly, deeply in love with a piece of software? <br/><br/>This is about the eighth system I've tried over my 10 years working online. As far as value for money, ease of use and most of all how practical the system is for the day to day running of a business, Teamwork Projects makes all the others look like idiots. I can't see myself ever using anything else now. <br/><br/>Other systems - while helping me plan and stay organised - also required me to have the extra job of keeping the system itself organised - or to remember to check things - or it didn't work 100% of the time (e.g. Reminders!) - or the system wasn't as logical/practical as it could have been - or it didn't have certain features that obviously should be there... <br/><br/>The Teamwork Projects interface is great and before long I've started to be able to relax more in my work because Teamwork Projects does a lot of my thinking for me! And I can trust it to do that. <br/><br/>It has all the features that any type of business could want. It saves you time and reduces stress. Everyone on a team is clear about everything that is happening. It is beautiful. <br/><br/>Victor Taylor. Operations Manager, Zavive.com.</p>

The combination of multiple team members sharing projects and a handful of remote employees, meant that we had a lot of information that wasn't being consistently documented or tracked. <br/>Teamwork Projects has completely changed how we get work done, interact with team members and improved workflow with remote employees who now have access from anywhere. We evaluated several project management programs before determining Teamwork Projects gave us the most flexibility & features to make it easy for the team to learn & adopt. We cannot imagine going back to our old ways, and still can't believe we operated without Teamwork Projects for so long!</p>

								<p>I am a freelance Project Manager. I have been using Teamwork Projects for about 1 year now, with my first client, then I was hired by another client who wanted me to set up his TW account, then I recommended it to this third client who accepted it with great ease and joy.<br/><br/>What I want to say is that you amaze me with all the changed you keep bringing in ... all so useful and making our PMs lives so much easy. I also love that you are constant in developing new features. We don't have to wait for months for new versions. Your newsletter is one of the few I completely and avidly read! I'm still unhappy with the files system, but believe me, the changes you put in on the rest make that issue so unimportant!<br/><br/>Thank you once again, you rock!</p>

I did not even need to read the manual. It is so well layed out and very easy to use. Training other users has been very very straight forward also.<br/><br/>Having the App for iPad and iPhone is fabulous for a project manager as you don't need to lug your laptop around to all your meetings.......just update on the App.<br/><br/>Love it!

								<p>But if you have not tried this solution I would not purchase or move in any direction till you give this a shot! I have tried many of the products in the market as we are needing some specific fundamentals that most products do not offer and we find that this covers most of our needs. Those areas that are not covered we simply type in the Suggestions and Feedback section of the site and we find them being worked into the integration of the product! They do a great job of keeping us and our ideas at the top of there list and I am sure we are not alone...<br/><br/>Test this product before you decide on ANY other product, you will be sorry (in my opinion) if you do not. We wasted a lot of time on other products that just don't provide the needs of our group. Forget about asking for new features! Many of the other Project Management solutions are either "Complete" meaning are not developing new features or don't seem to be interested in your needs! You will find this untrue of Team WORK! They are the best!<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and give this solution a try, for goodness sake you can try it for free!<br/><br/>AllinJac<br/>http://allinjac.com</p>

								<p>This is so good<br/><br/>Just a wee note to say just how good I find using Teamwork Projects. I have used a number of other pm systems and nothing has the overall value of this system. Yes there is some way to go yet, but I know you are on the case and working on it. Anyone who can't lift their working efficiency 100% or more using Teamwork Projects is not trying very hard.<br/><br/>Tech support responses are typically rec'd within minutes. Outstanding. I am factoring in Teamwork Projects to all my future projects both as an aid to efficient PM and as an add-on benefit of working with me.<br/><br/>You are doing great work. Keep it up. I will be referring Teamwork Projects to all my clients and associates as an essential tool for anyone that needs to coordinate a team on a project.<br/><br/>Tony</p>

								<p>Dear Teamwork Projects, I could not help but write and share my testimony about TWPM.<br/><br/>We are a technology startup in New Zealand and have been using TeamWorkPM for almost a year. Our team has grown and TWPM has been such a critical tool to manage many areas of our business, from team members, capital raising, software development, marketing, internal governance etc. Being a startup our selves we can only appreciate what TWPM have achieved.<br/><br/>Your product is second to none and certainly your service and response times sets a new standard. This is a most valuable and affordable tool for any startup (or business for that matter). Many thanks to your team and we look forward to the continual evolution of TWPM.</p>

We now rely heavily on the project and task features of the system to plan and assign work and keep on top of important milestones.  The regular updates to the product are very welcome and the team has been responsive on both support and development queries.
