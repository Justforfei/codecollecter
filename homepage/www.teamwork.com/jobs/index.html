									<h4>The Job</h4>
									<p> 	<strong>Teamwork.com</strong> is a company founded by developers, built to give our outstanding crew of programmers the best possible environment to write great code and build the world class products that our customers love. Developing great software is our DNA - it&#39;s what drives us, excites us, and it&#39;s what&rsquo;s built us an incredible business.</p> <p> 	That excellence has been rewarded with hundreds of thousands of amazing customers all across the globe and millions of users who sign in every day to trust us with getting their businesses organized and running productively. We&rsquo;re a profitable, entirely self-funded business with no investors or outside influences beyond one - our customers and what&#39;s best for them. &nbsp;</p> <p> 	It&rsquo;s a responsibility that we take very seriously. We&rsquo;re a company of action, full of try&rsquo;ers and do&rsquo;ers. We try stuff &ndash; new software, new languages, new techniques, we make mistakes and we learn from them. We work hard, together as a team and individually when it suits better. We are looking for developers with real passion for their work, who love learning and who would thrive in a &ldquo;come see what I did&rdquo; environment.&nbsp;</p> <p> 	<a href="../chat.html" target="_blank"><strong>Teamwork Chat</strong></a> is our second major product release and in the short time since we released the Beta, we&rsquo;ve gotten incredible feedback. Now it&#39;s time to build and expand the Teamwork Chat product team and we&rsquo;re looking for you. &nbsp;</p> <p> 	Talented developers will get to grips quickly with our code. We write CoffeeScript for Node.js, NW.js (Windows, Mac &amp; Linux), mobile (Android &amp; iOS), and the Web. Some of our favorite tools include: Knockout.js, jQuery, Browserify, LESS, and gulp.&nbsp;</p> <p> 	Send us on details of your projects, let us see what you&rsquo;ve done in the past. If you&rsquo;ve used a Teamwork Chat client, we&rsquo;d love to know what you&rsquo;d change or how you&rsquo;d improve it.</p> 
									<h4>Must Have</h4>
									<ul> 	<li> 		<strong>&#39;JavaScript: The Great Parts&#39;</strong> - You&#39;re very accustomed to JavaScript. You craft and comment your code, but also include a duck punch / hack when needed. It&#39;s not necessary to know library X.js or framework Y.js, but you&#39;d be completely comfortable digging into either of them because they&#39;re written in JavaScript.</li> 	<li> 		<strong>Bring your opinions</strong> - We&#39;re continuously improving and we want you to make your voice heard; whether it may be to switch to your favourite promise library, ditch Browserify, or even just your opinion on Sublime Text.</li> 	<li> 		<strong>Test-driven</strong> - Writing tests isn&#39;t a chore for you.</li> 	<li> 		<strong>MySQL</strong> - You can handle writing some MySQL queries without crawling into a ball and crying.</li> 	<li> 		<strong>Learn as you go</strong> - You have an open mind and are able to pick things up quickly. If we decide to re-write our servers in Go, we&#39;ll want your support.</li> </ul> 
									<h4>Nice To Have</h4>
									<ul> 	<li> 		<strong>Node.js</strong> - Knowing Node would give you a headstart as our desktop clients and our servers run on it.</li> 	<li> 		<strong>Responsive LESS</strong> - We like to write mobile-first responsive (pre-processed) CSS. We hope you do too. Mobile-Web experience would be great to have.</li> 	<li> 		<strong>CoffeeScript</strong></li> 	<li> 		<strong>Open-source</strong> - We depend on and often contribute to open-source projects. If it&#39;s broken, why not fix it?</li> 	<li> 		<strong>Show us what you got</strong> - Nothing speaks louder or shows us more about you than showing us examples of your work.</li> </ul> 
									<h4>Perks and Benefits</h4>
									<p> 	Working at&nbsp;<strong>Teamwork.com</strong>&nbsp;isn&#39;t like a normal job. We believe in hiring only the best and then looking after them like they deserve. On top of a great financial package, we do everything possible to make Teamwork.com a great place to work.</p> <ul> 	<li> 		A&nbsp;<strong>Competitive Salary</strong>, earn what you&#39;re worth, with regular reviews.</li> 	<li> 		<strong>Unparalleled Freedom</strong>&nbsp;in how you do your job. Spot something that needs improving? Off you go, make it happen.</li> 	<li> 		An unmatched&nbsp;<strong>Work Environment</strong>&nbsp;- built to make life easy and constantly improved.</li> 	<li> 		Only the very&nbsp;<strong>Best Equipment</strong>&nbsp;- whatever your role, you&#39;ll have the very best kit to help you get stuff done.</li> 	<li> 		<strong>Commitment to Growth</strong>. We want to see our team members grow and expand their skills. We&#39;re committed to your long term future at the company and will help you improve and enhance your skills.&nbsp;</li> 	<li> 		Subsidized&nbsp;<strong>Gym Membership</strong>, you choose the gym.</li> 	<li> 		Discounted&nbsp;<strong>Travel Schemes</strong>, Bike to Work Scheme, etc.</li> 	<li> 		In-house&nbsp;<strong>Games Room</strong>.</li> 	<li> 		Plenty of in-house&nbsp;<strong>Snacks and&nbsp;Refreshments.</strong></li> 	<li> 		Regular&nbsp;<strong>Company-sponsored Lunches</strong>&nbsp;and Nights Out.</li> </ul>

									<ul> 	<li> 		<strong>&#39;JavaScript: The Great Parts&#39;</strong> - You&#39;re very accustomed to JavaScript. You craft and comment your code, but also include a duck punch / hack when needed.

If we decide to re-write our servers in Go, we&#39;ll want your support.</li> </ul> 
									<h4>Nice To Have</h4>
									<ul> 	<li> 		<strong>Node.js</strong> - Knowing Node would give you a headstart as our desktop clients and our servers run on it.</li> 	<li> 		<strong>Responsive LESS</strong> - We like to write mobile-first responsive (pre-processed) CSS. We hope you do too. Mobile-Web experience would be great to have.</li> 	<li> 		<strong>CoffeeScript</strong></li> 	<li> 		<strong>Open-source</strong> - We depend on and often contribute to open-source projects. If it&#39;s broken, why not fix it?</li> 	<li> 		<strong>Show us what you got</strong> - Nothing speaks louder or shows us more about you than showing us examples of your work.</li> </ul>
